I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://ai.nycu.edu.tw/en/">College of AI</a>, <a href="https://en.nycu.edu.tw/">National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)</a>. My research areas include computer graphics and geometric processing, AI/neural networks, and computer vision.  In particular, I am interested in applications of machine learning and AI in the modeling of urban environments including architecture, floor plans, and urban planning. I also work with hospitals to develop AI-based methods for medicine.

I was a research scientist at the Visual Computing Center at <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa">King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)</a>, , working with Prof. <a href="http://peterwonka.net/">Peter Wonka</a>. I was a postdoctoral researcher at University College London (UCL), , working with Prof. <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/">Niloy Mitra</a>. I worked at Nogle, a software company based in Taipei, on the 3D modelling and simulation of garments. During my PhD studies, I was a summer research intern at Adobe ATL (supervised by Dr. Nathan Carr and Radomir Mech). I worked at CyberLink, the maker of PowerDVD video players, as a software engineer for four years. I was the co-founder of an online taxi carpooling company serving the Taipei metropolitan area.

I received PhD in Computer Science at Arizona State University, supervised by Prof. Peter Wonka. My research interests were computer graphics, geometric modelling, and urban environment design. I received my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science at National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Taiwan.
