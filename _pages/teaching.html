<h2>3D Computer Vision (三維電腦視覺)</h2>
<p>Graduate course, College of AI, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), Taiwan<br>
Fall 2021, Fall 2022</p>
<p>In this course I taught fundamental concepts about 3D reconstruction such as non-linear projection models (e.g., panoramas and equirectangular
projections),  epipolar geometry, stereo reconstruction and image depths, LiDAR basics, point cloud registrations and triangulations, 
meshes and parameterization, and deep learning/neural network applications in 3D reconstruction.

<h2>Introduction to Computer Graphics (計算機圖形學總論)</h2>
<p>Graduate course, College of AI, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), Taiwan<br>
Spring 2021, Spring 2022, Spring 2023</p>
<p> In this course I taught computer graphics with an emphasis on real-time rendering, including the 3D-to-2D rasterization pipeline, 
Model-View-Projection projections, shader programming basics (e.g., Blinn-Phong shading), textures and environmental mapping, splines, 
subdivision surfaces, keyframe-based animations, photorealstic rendering (ray tracing) basics, and modern
deep learning/neural network applications in CG such as NeRFs.

<h2>Integer Programming for Visual Computing</h2>
<p>Short course, Siggraph Asia 2018 and 2020<br>
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415263.3419150">Course (ACM DL)</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/files/CourseIntegerProgramming.pdf">Slides (author's version)</a></p>
<p>I was the co-host in two courses at Siggraph Asia 2018 Tokyo and Siggraph Asia 2020 Virtual, 
titled “Integer Programming for Visual Computing”, with Prof. Peter Wonka.
